# FEND - My Reads

We were provided with a starter template. Our job was to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.

The "MyReads" app allows us to categorize books by reading status: "currently reading", "want to read" and "read". You can change categories and also get some new books thanks to the search page. 

## Want to see it?

To see the project :

* clone this repository
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
